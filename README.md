### :running: **Main purpose of the project**
This script locates for you the best gluten free alternatives in your city and remarks the cheapest one and the one which is closest to you. This may be part of a bigger app.

### :monocle_face: **Instructions**

Once executing the script add -l (current address) and -m (walking/bicycling/transit/driving)

Example: python main.py -l liencres -m driving
 

### :computer: **Technology stack**
- Programming language: Python
- Libraries: Googlemaps, gmaps, requests, pandas, etc. (All you need is in requirements.txt)
- HTML (w3school level)


### :thinking:**Application and situations you may find No More Gluten APP interesting** :thinking:


- :heavy_check_mark: When you are in a city you don't and you may need to locate an establishment with gluten free options.
- :heavy_check_mark: When you discover that your tinder date does not eat gluten and you need some ideas
- :heavy_check_mark: When you just want to have a nice gluten free meal with your friends.

### :full_moon_with_face: **Wish List**
1. I wish i have the opportunity to embeb the export obtained with this script in a web app where the users could see much more information.
2. Webscrap Tripadvisor web just to obtain more detailed information from any establishment



Note: This project would be better if every local improves their GoogleMyBusiness profiles adding all the information they can bring to their customers.

Special Mention to my MCA.
